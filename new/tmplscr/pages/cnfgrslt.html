This is <b>for those who are comfortable with HTML</b>. 
<p>
This gives you amazing flexibility to <b>customize the search results page to look exactly the way you want it to look</b>. In this method you will not fill any forms, but instead you will <b>enter the HTML code itself in a text area and submit</b>. 
<p>
If you are comfortable with HTML, I recommend you use this method.
