<a name="31"><b>How does the Grepin Site Search work? </b></a>
<ol type=1>
<lh>Grepin Site Search is made of 2 components. 
<br />
<br />
<li><u>Grepinbot</u> - a robot that crawls through your web site indexing all the content in your web pages. It reads the content of your page, parses it, indexes it in our index tables on our servers. 
<br />
<br />
<li><u>Grepin Search</u> - a search program that scans the index tables to retrieve the information requested by your visitor through a search box. It will first rank the results based on our algorithm. Then it will sort the results, and display them on the screen in a search results page configured by you. It also logs your visitor's search query in a log database.
