<li>The basic use of a Site Search is to help your visitors find what they are looking for. According to statistics, about 50% of web visitors leave a web site because they can't go through the links all the way to the page they are looking for. The Site Search will help them find the page right away, and keep the visitors in your site from wandering off to another one. This could mean increasing your income by 100%.
<br />
Put a search box or a search link in every page of your web site and it will improve the usability of your web site. 
<br />
<br />
<li>Put a link of the search results (of specific key-words) in your ezines, reports, ebooks, etc., to list out all the concerned pages to your subscribers. This will bring them right to the spot that they are interested in, eliminating the pains of searching for the right content. These links will make your ezines, reports, etc., more friendly and can attract more subscribers. The friendly ezines will also increase your conversion rate of visitor to customer.
<br />
<br />
<li>The search activity reports from a Site Search is the most valuable information you can get. (Grepin Site Search gives you 3 types of reports - detailed, monthly, and summary.) 
<br />The most searched keywords are the most important ones. This is what your visitors are looking for in your web site. You will find these keywords in the search activity reports.
<br />You should build content around these keywords and your visitors will be very happy, because that is what they want. And also these content pages will attract more and more new visitors, especially happy ones. "A happy visitor is more likely to become a customer."
<br />
<br />
<li>Want to know what you should write in your next newsletter? No problem. Just take a look at your search activity reports and you can tell what will interest your subscribers. 
<br />
<br />
<li>Want to find out what you should sell on your web site? Again the search activity reports will come to rescue. Just look at them and you can tell what your visitors want most. Once you have this information, you have 2 choices. 
<br />
<br />
<ul type=disc>
<li>Create a product that fullfills your visitors needs and sell it on your web site, or 
<br />
<br />
<li>Signup for affiliate programs that sells the products that your visitor desires, and promote them on your web site.
</ul>
<br />
<li>The keywords that your visitors search for are also your target keywords. Take them to pay-per-click search engines, bid for them, and get highly targeted visitors who are more likely to turn into customers.
<br />
<br />
<li>Add your other related websites in the search and send the traffic in the most natural way to your other sites. You can create a path from one site that has high volume of visitors to the one that has low volume of visitors without losing your credibility and without losing value. In fact you will be providing more value to your visitors by helping them find information that is in your other site without them going through all the hassle.
