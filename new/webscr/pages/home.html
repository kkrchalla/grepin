<b>"50% of web visitors are lost because they can’t find what they are looking for."</b>
</font>
</center>

<p>
<br />
<b>Wouldn't it be great if somehow all those lost visitors are "not lost"? </b>
<br />
<br />
Let's say that we have a way to keep those visitors. What would that mean to you?
<br />
I would say <b>a 100% increase in your income</b>. 
<br />
<br />
All you have to do is make it easier for your visitors to find the information they are looking for.
He should find the information in just a couple of clicks. The more number of clicks, the more frustrated he/she gets. And frustrated visitors are more likely to leave the web site.

<p>
So, now a question. <b>"I already have excellent navigation links in my web site. Isn't that enough for my visitor to find the right information on my web site?"</b>
<p>
Well, there are 2 reasons that the navigation links may not be enough.
<ul type=disk>
<li>You cannot describe your page completely in a couple of words that you use in the navigational links, can you? The information that your visitor is looking for might be in a page. But its name might not describe it well enough for your visitor to click the link.
<li>If your web site is over 25 pages, it would be extremely difficult to have all your pages accessible in a couple of clicks using your navigational links. And above all, more links mean more difficult for your visitor to find the right one.
</ul>
<b>"Well you convinced me. Now, how can I make it easier for my visitor to find the right information, right away, on my web site?"</b>
<p>
The answer is "Grepin Site Search".
<br />
Yes. Grepin Site Search is a tool that can help your visitors find the right information, right away.

<b><u>What is a Grepin Site Search?</u></b>
<blockquote>
Grepin Site Search is much like web search engines but will only search your site. It is <b>the fastest way to find anything on your web site, as long as it is on your web site</b>. 
<br />
Grepinbot, an indexing robot, will index your site and stores it on our dedicated server. Then whenever your visitor searches for something, Grepin Site Search will look through the index and presents the results to your user. It also logs every search activity that happens on your web site so you can see what your visitors are searching.
