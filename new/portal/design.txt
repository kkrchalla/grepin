   signup for your own portal
   maintain it on your own
   visitors will submit their urls to be added to portal
      these urls can be added automatically 
      or can be put on wait till the owner edits them and adds them
   each url submitted will have the keywords and description
   each url submitted will have the user name and his personal url 
      and this name with url will be part of the results
   each portal owner will add his products as per the keywords
   his report will show all the keywords that everyone is searching for 
      and also those that do not have products
   you can publish your submitted urls with keywords to other users
   you can subscribe the published urls by the keywords
   you still can accept or deny the subscribed urls
   when you subscribe an url and when it is displayed there will also be the source displayed
      so if you publish, you will have more visibility
      and when you subscribe, you are giving more visibility to others as well

   all the portals will have top advertising bar, right side advertising bar, 
      and probably bottom advertising bar
   one of these bars will have my advertising or from some pay-per-click search engine...
