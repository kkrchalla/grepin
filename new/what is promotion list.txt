What is a promotion list?

This is a horizontal bar or a vertical bar (skyscraper) with list of products that would bring you money.
This bar eventually "promotes" the products "listed" in it and is displayed in your web page.
So, I call this a promotion list.

This promotion list can be displayed in any kind of web page, be it a content page or search results page. 

This is much like google bar that you see for Google Adsense program.

But here you will have control over what products are displayed in this bar.
You get to create your own list of products and program them the way you want them to work.

And you get detailed reports of everything that happens on your page regarding this bar.
